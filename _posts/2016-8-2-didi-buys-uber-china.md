title: Didi Purchases Uber China
---
The [WSJ Reports on Didi purchasing Uber China](http://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-the-chinese-uber-rival-buying-uberchina-1470065923). For one of my abroad classes in Hong Kong, I discussed the ridesharing economy in general. I argued that Uber would dominate global ride sharing since it can provide a consistent service anywhere across the globe and other ridesharing companies would be pushed to partner with one another. I thought that the competition between Didi and Uber was too close to call, but I didn't think that one company would sell to another.

Uber took on a monsterous challenge to beat a Chinese company on Chinese soil yet failed. However, compared to other American companies, Uber was able to sell its Chinese subsidiary for an 18% stake in Didi. Due to the complexities of China and stiff competition, I believe that Uber was able to gain some benefit from their Chinese operations. It's not a total loss for Uber, but Uber further proves that operations in China continue to be incredibly challenging.
