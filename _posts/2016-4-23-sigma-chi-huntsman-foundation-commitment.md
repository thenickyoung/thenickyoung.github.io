title: Santa Clara Sigma Chi Raises over $20K for Hunstman Cancer Institute
---
I am incredibly proud to be a part of an organization that provides the opportunity to take a stand and raise money to find a cure for cancer. [Santa Clara was able to raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwQabmtU8M&feature=youtu.be) over $20,000 toward cancer research for the second consecutive year.

It's an ambitious goal, but I truly believe that we are the generation that ends cancer. Help [by donating here](http://www.derbychallenge.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=1163823).
